Lab Overview: Using event handlers that live on a parent element and serve 
many children — a pattern called event delegation. Use closest() to walk up the
DOM tree to the element you care about, and matches() to test whether an element fits a CSS
selector before acting on it. These three tools together let you write leaner, more maintainable
UI code with far fewer listeners.
